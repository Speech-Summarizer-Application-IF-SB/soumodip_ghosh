Speech-to-Text Summarization System – Milestone 3

This milestone delivers a complete speech-to-text summarization system that transforms audio recordings into accurate, speaker-labeled transcriptions and concise summaries. The system is designed with modularity and usability in mind, supporting multiple audio formats including WhatsApp recordings.

Project Structure

pipeline.py – Handles audio loading, segmentation, and speaker diarization.

summarizer.py – Converts long transcripts into concise summaries.

app_module_5_6.py & app_module_5_6_streamlit.py – Provide script-based and Streamlit-based user interfaces.

uploads/ – Folder for testing audio input files.

outputs/ – Folder for storing generated transcriptions, summaries, and other processed results.

speech_to_Text (1).ipynb – Notebook for experimenting with speech-to-text processing.

transcript_with_speakers.txt, summary.txt, transcription.txt – Sample output files demonstrating system results.

app.py – Main application entry point to run the full system.

requirements.txt & README.md – Dependencies and documentation for setup and usage.

Key Features

Converts audio to text with accurate speaker identification.

Generates clear and concise summaries from large transcripts.

Supports multiple audio formats, including real-world recordings.

Modular architecture allows easy upgrades or integration of new models.

Streamlit interface provides an interactive and user-friendly experience.

Outcome

By the end of this milestone, users can:

Upload audio files and obtain clean, speaker-tagged transcriptions.

Automatically generate intelligible summaries from transcripts.

Use an interactive interface to process and visualize results efficiently.

This system is ideal for applications in research, meetings, lectures, or any scenario requiring transcription and summarization of multi-speaker audio recordings.
