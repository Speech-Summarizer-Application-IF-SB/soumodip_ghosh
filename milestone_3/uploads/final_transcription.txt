[1.26 - 3.57] The stale smell of old beer lingers.
[4.49 - 6.27] It takes heat to bring out the odor.
[7.11 - 9.44] A cold dip restores health and zest.
[10.08 - 12.08] A salt pickle tastes fine with ham.
[12.70 - 14.51] Tacos al pastor are my favorite.
[15.23 - 17.85] A zestful food is the hot cross bun.
